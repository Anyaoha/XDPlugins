  "description": "Toggle easily between a light color palette and a dark one. This plugin is made to help you manage dark mode in your project without duplicating the project.\n\nTo use DarkModeToggler properly :\n 1. Use the \"Generate assets variants\" button to transform your normal color assets (which are named) in compatible ones OR for each color asset, create a name/light and name/dark version and then use the \"Reload colors\" button\n2. Switch between light-mode and dark-mode via the DarkModeToggler\n3. Edit colors via the Adobe XD assets panel\n\nBecause of software restrictions, this plugin is not able to edit : circular gradients, repeatGrids and objects into a shape mask. It can change in the futur if these restrictions are removed.\n\nThis plugin was designed and developed by Romain Penchenat [https://romainpenchenat.com]",
